# Blog App

This is a Flutter project for a simple blog application. The app uses various technologies and patterns for state management, local storage, and backend services. The main features of the app include:

- **State Management**: The app uses Provider package for state management, allowing for efficient and reactive updates to the UI.
- **Local Storage**: Hive is used for local storage, enabling the app to store blog posts locally on the device.
- **Backend Services**: The app is integrated with Supabase for backend services, such as authentication and storing blog posts remotely.
- **Clean Architecture**: The project follows clean architecture principles, separating concerns into different layers (presentation, domain, data) for better maintainability and testability.
